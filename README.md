# Generative Art Repository üé®üñ•Ô∏è

Welcome to my "generative_art" repository, where I explore the fascinating intersection of art and technology through p5.js. This repository is a canvas for my experiments with generative art, showcasing the beauty of algorithms and randomness.

## About Me

I am a Brazilian artist and ceramics teacher, deeply engaged with the integration of traditional art forms and digital technologies. My background in architecture and a profound appreciation for Eastern ceramics influence my approach to generative art, blending structure with the organic unpredictability of natural patterns.

## Projects

Each folder in this repository contains a different p5.js sketch, focusing on various generative art concepts:
- **Random Movements**: Exploring the beauty of randomness and its application in creating fluid, organic patterns.
- **Spiral Forms**: Using mathematical models to generate spiral and fractal designs that mimic natural phenomena.
- **Interactive Installations**: Sketches designed for interactive art installations, allowing viewers to engage with the artwork dynamically.

## Technologies

This repository primarily uses:
- **p5.js**: A JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of processing.

## Collaboration

I am keen on collaborating with other artists, programmers, and researchers. If you have ideas, want to contribute, or are interested in using these sketches in your projects, please reach out.
